Jets - Week 3 Skill Distillery

Overview

The project is a jet app designed to:

- upload a text file of jet information into the program and display information about the jets;
- allow a user to enter their own custom jet;
- allow a user to select from a menu of options to: (1) list all of the jets in the program; (2) see various information about the jets; (3) display the fastest jet and the jet with the longest range; and (4) remove a jet form the program.

Technologies Used

- Eclipse
- Java
- GitHub/Git
- TextEdit

Lessons Learned

- I need to come up with a better system for putting code to the side that doesn't work as intended. I have been commenting it out to try something new, but the program is then littered with scraps of code that may not hurt the program, but are unnecessary and may come out in the final product;
- Finally learned how to implement foreach loops in limited cases, and they work as intended;
- super() is necessary for subclasses to be able use information declared in the superclass for interfaces;
